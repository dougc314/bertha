Large format Rostock style printer, built with aluminum extrusions.

My plan is to design a large printer, emphasizing quality over cost.  Ideally there will be the 'full' version, and then various lower cost options.

The design of the plastic parts contained her is complete - that's not to say they won't be updated, just that everything in here is functional.

I am working on build instructions in a blog over here: http://berthareprap.blogspot.com/2013/05/mark-4-finally.html
I am currently constructing the very first machine, so instructions are coming out as I get build time.

BOM will be posted for each step, and when I've completed the bot I'll post a full BOM here.


Frame: 2060 aluminum extrusion.
Linear motion: openrail, with Delrin V wheels.  Low cost option: Run the carriages in the extrusion grooves.
Drive: Synchromesh cable.  Low cost option: Fishing line.
Rods: Igus rod ends, square carbon fiber tube.
Extruders: Three of them.  Bowden style.
