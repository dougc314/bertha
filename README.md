large format Rostock style extrusion printer.

My plan is to design a large printer, emphasizing quality over cost.  Ideally there will be the 'full' version, and then various lower cost options.


Frame: 2060 aluminum extrusion.
Linear motion: openrail, with Delrin V wheels.  Low cost option: Run the carriages in the extrusion grooves.
Drive: Synchromesh cable.  Low cost option: Fishing line.
Rods: Igus rod ends, square carbon fiber tube.
Extruders: Three of them.  Bowden style.
